# Lilly Technical Challenge - Documentation

## Approach
My approach towards this challenge was to build a project in a structured, step-by-step way.
I had began by creating a step-by-step guide and confirmed it with using AI to see if all steps were accounted for. I then began setting up the FastAPI backend, because having working endpoints first makes it easier to build and test the frontend afterward.

I next connected the front-end to the back-end using 'fetch()' and displayed the /medicines endpoints dynamically on the page. Once the data displayed correctly, I improved the UI design, added responsiveness, and implemented form-based CRUD functions (Create/Read/Update/Delete).

Throughout the process, I used documentation from FastAPI, MDN Web Docs, and general CSS grid references. However, all functionality and design were done manually by me without copying from any templates.

I continuously kept track of my website by testing each step as I built it to ensure the system was stable before moving on.
